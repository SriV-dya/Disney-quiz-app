# ASSIGNMENT2 LEVEL0
    during the live session we made a basic cli application
    later on we were given an option to add chalk and more modularity
    so the second version is a disney quiz...before there was a problem with users spelling and use of uppercse letters

    new version solves it gives mcq's, and is a more colourful! and ofc more interactive
